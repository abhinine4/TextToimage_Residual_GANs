The proposed GAN model is built by conditioning the generated images on a text description instead of on a class label. We implemented a Deep Residual GAN network to create fine pictures from very latent noise. The coarse images are aligned to attributes and are embedded as the generator inputs and classifier labels. A straight route, similar to the Resnet, is covered in a generative network to directly transport coarse pictures to higher layers. In addition, adversarial training is used in a cyclic fashion to prevent picture degradation. Experimental results of applying the Deep Residual GAN model to datasets BIRD CUB-200 and FLICKR 8K show its higher accuracy to the state-of-art GANs.

## Steps to Run üßæ
1. Please refer to the READMEs in the folder Dataset, text_pkl, image_pkl, Weights and word2vec_pretrained_model to obtain the necessary data. 
2. Images pickle file can be found in Dataset folder that was created using  ```process_images.ipynb``` to resize and normalize the images and generate numpy arrays 
3. Captions pickle file can be found in Captions folder that was created using  ```process_captions.ipynb``` to generate sentence embeddings for the captions or use one provided in Captions folder
4. Trained model weights files can be found in the weights folder 
5. Import the jupyter notebook ```CSE_676_Text2Image_final.ipynb``` in Google Colab and load the data.
6. Run code snippets in Google Colab.

## Results  üöÄ
Below are some outputs of the DR-GAN model when the input text was given as ‚Äúa yellow bird with black tail‚Äù & ‚Äúa green  bird with black head‚Äù.
